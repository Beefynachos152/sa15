        <h2>Pasta Carbonara</h2>
        <p>A classic Italian dish with a rich, creamy sauce that's quick and easy to make but delicious!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>400g spaghetti</li>
            <li>150g pancetta or guanciale, cubed</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 additional egg yolk</li>
            <li>1 cup freshly grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, peeled</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Salt (for pasta water)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add spaghetti and cook until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water before draining.</li>
            <li>In a skillet over medium heat, cook the pancetta with the garlic clove until the fat renders and the pancetta becomes crispy, about 3-4 minutes. Remove and discard the garlic clove.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, egg yolk, and grated cheese. Season generously with freshly ground black pepper.</li>
            <li>Drain the pasta and add it immediately to the skillet with the pancetta. Remove from heat and pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta, quickly tossing and combining with the pasta. The heat from the pasta cooks the egg, creating a creamy sauce.</li>
            <li>Gradually add reserved pasta water to achieve the desired sauce consistency. It should be creamy and coat the pasta without being runny.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately, topped with additional grated cheese and a sprinkle of black pepper.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Cooking Tip:</strong> Use freshly grated Pecorino Romano for the best flavor and avoid letting the eggs scramble by constantly stirring as you combine them with the hot pasta.</p>

        <h2>Mango Smoothie</h2>
        <p>This refreshing mango smoothie is perfect for a hot summer day or as a healthy breakfast option. It's packed with vitamins and a sweet, creamy flavor.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ripe mangos, peeled and chopped</li>
            <li>1 banana, sliced (for added creaminess)</li>
            <li>2 cups milk (dairy or any plant-based alternative like almond, soy, or coconut milk)</li>
            <li>1 cup plain or vanilla yogurt (optional, for extra creaminess)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon honey, or to taste (adjust based on your preference for sweetness)</li>
            <li>Ice cubes (optional, for a chilled smoothie)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>

            <li>Place the mango pieces, banana slices, milk, and yogurt into a blender. Add honey for sweetness.</li>
            <li>If you prefer your smoothie cold, add a handful of ice cubes.</li>

            <li>Taste the smoothie and adjust the sweetness by adding more honey if needed. Blend again if additional honey is added.</li>
            <li>Pour the smoothie into glasses and serve immediately. Optionally, garnish with a few mango chunks or mint leaves for a refreshing touch.</li>
        </ol>
